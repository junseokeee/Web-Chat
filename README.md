image 4번 클릭시 json파일을 만드는 스크립트 실행
나머지 123들은 test.json(고토 히토리)를 기반으로 만들어진 챗봇 유형
**추후 버튼 링크만 바꿔서 커스텀 항목으로 만들면됨 

character.js는 만들다 만거니까 신경 x

병진이는 서버 구축만해서 json파일 다운로드 경로 로컬서버로 바꾸고 가져오는거 만들어주고 << 그게 뭔데
준스기햄은 서버 디비에서 챗봇 목록가져와서 화면상에 image 1234 배치해주는거 하면 될듯 
위 두개 다해서 나한테 말해주면 내가 custom.js 고쳐서 서버에서 챗봇 불러오는거랑 유료결제 시도해봄





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
